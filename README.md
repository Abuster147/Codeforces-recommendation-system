# Improve Codeforces Performance

This project aims to improve any CodeForces User's performances in the codeforces contests by using User's previous performance in contests as well as in the practice problem-set.

## Description

Also it gives problem recommendation based on the weak areas and user's current rating,to improve the performance in next contest.
